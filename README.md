# 🪙 TrustFold

## 📖 Project Description
**TrustFold** is a blockchain-based escrow system built with Solidity that enables two parties to engage in trustless transactions. It ensures that the deposited funds are securely held on the blockchain and only released when the agreed conditions are met, reducing the risk of fraud or disputes.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To establish a transparent and decentralized platform for digital agreements where users can confidently conduct peer-to-peer transactions without relying on intermediaries. TrustFold aims to redefine digital trust by automating escrow operations using blockchain technology.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Secure Escrow Creation**: Users can create an escrow by depositing Ether for a receiver.
- **Trustless Fund Release**: Only the sender can release funds when conditions are satisfied.
- **Refund Capability**: Allows refunding of escrow in case of disputes or cancellations.
- **Immutable & Transparent**: All transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Multi-party Escrow**: Support for multiple participants and arbitration mechanisms.
- **Token Support**: Enable ERC20 token-based escrows.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Integrate decentralized dispute management with voting mechanisms.
- **Frontend DApp Integration**: Develop a React-based decentralized application for easy user interaction.
